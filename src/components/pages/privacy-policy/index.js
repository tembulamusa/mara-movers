        <h1>Introduction and general terms</h1>

        <p>This privacy policy document is used to inform customers our policies on collection, use, and disclosure of
        Personal Information and data collected from website visitors. At Bikosports we are committed to protecting and
        respecting your privacy and maintaining the confidence and trust of our customers.</p>

        <li>Information about your online browsing behavior on the Website;</li>
        <li>Information about any devices you have used to access our Services (such as IP address)</li>
        <li>Recording phone calls – we may monitor or record phone calls with you. We might do this to check that
        we have carried out your instructions correctly; to resolve queries or issues; for regulatory purposes; to help
        improve our quality of service; to help us train our staff; or to help detect or prevent fraud or other crimes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Information you shared with us voluntarily or else, made public, like social media profiles.</p>

        <h2>B. Other sources of personal data</h2>

        <p>Where we provide personalized services, we may use third party data about you, for example, your Twitter
        or Facebook feeds, to get to know you better and to provide more effective personalization.         Data
        received in-house providing verification services and fraud prevention.</p>

        <h2>C. Information about third parties</h2>
        <p>If you give us personal information about someone else then you should not do so without their permission.
        Where information is provided by you about someone else, or someone else discloses information about
        you, it may be added to any personal information that is already held by us and it will be used in the ways
        described in this Privacy Policy. This list of personal data types collected by Bikosports is not exhaustive and
        further information may be requested from you when Bikosports considers it fair and necessary to do so.</p>

        <h2>D. Special categories of data: </h2>
        <p>Personal data collected by Bikosports may include so called “special categories of
        data”, such as data revealing health (in relation to responsible gaming policies).</p>

        <h1>Why do we collect your Personal Data and on what basis?</h1>

        <p>We recognize the trust and confidence our customers place in us as a service provider. In return, Bikosports is open
        about why we collect your data. First and foremost, collecting your information is essential for providing you
        the services and products you want. In addition, your data is used to personalize and improve your experience
        using our services, and to contact you from time to time with important information. In some cases, we need to
        collect and use your information to comply with the law. Under data protection laws, we also need to identify a
        specified lawful basis upon which we are processing your personal information. We rely on different bases for
        different processing activities.</p>

        <p><b>A. Under the contract</b> – when it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party. Our

        maintenance, updates to our Privacy and Cookies Policy or Terms of Use, to let you know if your Bikosports
        account has become dormant and to ask if you would like to use it again before we close it;</p>
        <p>to assess betting risk - when you make a bet, an automated system may be used to assess the risk connected
        to your bet, in accordance with our Betting Rules. It is a system widely used by the betting operators to help
        make fair and informed decisions on betting. Betting scoring takes account of information you provide
        (both, at registration and through your use of our services). If your bet has been rejected or limited, you
        have the right to ask for a manual assessment by our agents.</p>
        <p>to process your transactions;</p>

        you were told at the time you provided your data, what your expectations are about the processing of the
        data, the nature of the data, and the impact of the processing on you.</p>

        <h2>G. Under the legal obligation – when it is necessary in order to comply with mandatory legal obligations.</h2>

        <p>to determine where you are accessing the services from to redirect you to the correct country site, in
        accordance with our license conditions;</p>
        <p>to make sure we offer our services to eligible persons;</p>

        <p>to carry out appropriate anti-fraud checks (by conducting online searches using a third party identity
            provider). Please note that this will not affect your credit rating;</p>
        <p>to ensure your personal information remains accurate. In connection with these obligations we may
    periodically re-verify the personal data we hold about you to ensure it remains accurate and current
    (including by disclosing your personal data to and receiving personal data about you from third party identity

    allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers on that site in future. If you want to stop
    all personalized services from us, including targeted advertising messages on third party sites you can contact
    us to disable personalization. We also like to hear your views to help us to improve our services, so we may

    market research.</p>

        <h1>Your rights & choices over your personal information</h1>.

        <p>We appreciate that by law and subject to certain conditions, you have a number of rights concerning the personal information we hold about you. If you wish to exercise these rights, you should contact us. These rights include the right to access, amend and erase the personal information we hold about you, the right to object to the processing of your data, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to data portability. You also have the right to complain to your data protection authority if you are concerned with how we process your information. In addition, you have certain rights relating to automated decision-making and ‘profiling’. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from your country’s data protection regulator. o The personal information we ask for on registration is compulsory (unless indicated in the forms as optional) and we need it to be able to process your registration, contact you and comply with gambling and financial laws to which you are subject. Unfortunately, therefore, if you do not want to provide such personal information, you will not be able to use our services.</p>
        <p>You have a right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you, known as a data subject access request. You also have the right to request that information we hold about you which may be incorrect, or which has been changed since you first told us, is updated or removed.  o   In some circumstances, you can ask us to erase personal information we hold about you. This includes when:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>the information is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected; if you previously gave consent to the use of your information, but decide to withdraw it and we cannot justify another legal ground for using it under data protection law; </p>
        <p>we process your information based on our legitimate interests and we cannot demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing the information;</p>
        <p>we don’t have a lawful ground under data protection law to process your information; </p>
        <p>the data has to be erased to comply with a legal requirement; </p>
        <p>This    right    is subject to mandatory retention periods under local laws.</p>
        <p>You have the right to ask us to restrict the processing of your personal information. When processing is restricted, we can still store your information, but will not use it further. This right is</p>
        <p>available to you when:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>you dispute the accuracy of the personal information (while we verify matters);</p>
        <p>the processing is unlawful, and you object to the erasure of the information and request that we restrict processing instead;</p>
        <p>we no longer need the data, but you require it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; and</p>
        <p>we process your information for our legitimate business interests but you object and while we verify the grounds for continued processing.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You have the right to receive personal information you provide to us, in a ‘commonly used machine-readable format’. This allows you to obtain and reuse your information for your own purposes across different services. For example, if you decide to switch to a different provider, this enables you to move, copy or transfer your information easily between our IT systems and theirs safely and securely, without affecting its usability. This is not a general right however, and only arises when the processing of your information is:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>based on your consent or where it is necessary for the performance of a contract, and when the information is processed by solely by automated means</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Based on your particular situation, you can object to the processing of your personal information, that is:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>based on our legitimate business interests (including profiling); or done for research and statistical purposes</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You also have the right to object to the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes (including profiling), such as when you receive emails from us notifying you about other Bikosports services which we think will be of interest to you.</p>
        <p>When we rely on your consent as the basis to process your personal information – such as for sales and marketing communications – you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us.</p>
        <p>We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information. This helps us to make sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct, based on what we know.  These automated decisions can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future, or the ability to use our services.</p>
        <p>We may use automate decisions making in the following situations:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>tailoring products and services – we may pace you in groups with similar customers (segments) to study and learn about preferences and your needs, and offer more tailored experience for you;</p>
        <p>detecting fraud - we use your personal information to help decide and detect if your account may be being used for fraud or money-laundering. If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may block or suspend the account;</p>
        <p>opening account - when you open an account with us, we check that the product or service is relevant for you, based on what we know. We also check that you meet the conditions needed to open the account. This may include checking age, residency, nationality or financial position; risk assessment connected to your bet.</p>
        <p>Data protection law seeks to safeguard individuals against harm that may arise from decision-making - including profiling - that takes place without human intervention. You have the right not to be subject to a decision - including profiling - when it is based on the automated processing of your personal information and it has a legal effect or a similarly significant effect on you. Please note that the right does not apply when the processing is:</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>necessary for entering into or for the performance of a contract with you; or</p>
        <p>when it is authorized by law; or</p>
        <p>when it is based on your explicit consent.</p>

        <h1>Security: </h1>
        <p>We value your trust in availing your Personal Information to us, we thus strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it from any unauthorized external or internal access without your consent.

These include but are not limited to inclusive of, but not limited to acts of God or natural disasters and including power cuts and strikes.  Furthermore, no method of transmission over the internet, or electronic storage is 100% secure or offers absolute reliability. We therefore cannot guarantee absolute security.  </p>
