<p>You acknowledge and agree that the material and content contained within the Website is made available for your personal non-commercial use only. Any other use of such content is strictly prohibited. You agree not to assist or facilitate any third party to copy, reproduce, transmit, publish, display, distribute, commercially exploit, tamper with or create derivative works of such material and content.</p>
<h2>TERMS AMENDMENTS</h2>
<p>The Terms can be changed at any time by the Company at its own discretion. All changes will become effective upon their publication on the site.</p>
<p>In case of substantial amendment to the Terms, the Company will give notice to Clients prior to such amendment taking effect. For minor or insubstantial amendments to the Terms, the Company need not notify the Clients.</p>
<h2>APPLICABLE LAW</h2>
<p>All betting contracts, as well as any other legal relationship between the Client and the Company, for every circumstance not regulated by these Terms, is subject to Tanzanian law.</p>
<p>The Courts of Tanzania are agreed as the ultimate place of jurisdiction in the event of any dispute arising between the Client and the Company.</p>
<h2> 2. YOUR BIKOSPORTS ACCOUNT</h2>
<p>Each Client who wants to have access to the services offered by the Company must firstly open a betting account with the Company. By opening an account and by placing a bet, the Client warrants that they have reached the minimum legal age for participation. In addition, by opening a betting account with the Company and by placing a bet, the Client confirms that they retain the legal capacity to enter into an agreement with the Company. If one of these conditions is not respected the Client's account will be closed.</p>
<p>The beneficial owner of the linked mobile money account and the Bikosports account must be the same person.</p>
<p>All payouts via wallet transfers can only be made to the person, who owns the Bikosports account that requested the wallet transfer. So, the name and the phone number in the Bikosports account must match with the wallet account holder details, where the transfer was requested.</p>
<p>It is prohibited for Clients to buy, sell or transfer betting accounts to other Clients or other third parties.</p>
<p>When a new account is opened the Client is responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. The Company reserves the right to close the account when the information provided is deemed to be false or inaccurate.</p>
<p>Every betting account is linked with an individual SIM card (phone number) and all account transactions are unique to that SIM. Funds cannot be transferred from one account / SIM to another.</p>
<p>The Company retains the right to close the betting account(s) of any Client who has opened multiple betting accounts under their name, or under different names, or</p>
<p>when a Client has placed multiple similar bets, if it has reasonable grounds to believe that those multiple betting accounts (even if under different names) or</p>
<p>multiple similar bets have been opened with the intention of deceiving the Company by masking the totality of the betting activity of any individual or syndicate or to defeat the bet limits set by the Company. The Company also reserves the right to cancel any transactions related to such deceit.</p>
<p>After opening an account, the Client must keep their account access details secret as all transactions where access details have been entered correctly will be regarded as valid. The Company shall not be liable for any claims in the event that the Client gives away, tells, shares, fails to protect or loses their access details.</p>
<p>The Client is entitled to apply for the closure or suspension of their account whenever they wish by making a request to Customer Services by email or telephone. The closure of the account will correspond to the termination of the Terms. In case the reason behind the closure of the account is related to concerns about gambling addiction, the Client shall indicate this.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Company’s legal obligations, all personal details saved in our system will only be deleted at a Client's express request after the expiration of seven (6) years.</p>
<h2>3. YOUR FINANCES</h2>
<p><b>DEPOSITS AND BETS</b></p>
<p>You may only bet with the amount of cleared funds held in your account. Accordingly, if you want to place bets or participate in gaming, you must deposit funds into your account. Further details of how to deposit, withdraw and transfer funds can be found at Deposits/Withdrawals.</p>
<p>By depositing funds into your account, you direct us and we agree to hold them, along with any winnings, for the sole and specific purpose of using them (i) to place your sporting and gaming stakes; and (ii) settling any fees or charges that you might incur in connection with the use of our services. We shall be entitled to suspend or close your account if we reasonably consider or have reason to believe that you are depositing funds without any intention to place sporting and/or gaming stakes. In such circumstances we may also report this to relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Bikosports reserves the right to void any bet which may have inadvertently been accepted when the account did not have sufficient funds to cover the bet. Should funds be credited to a customer's account in error it is the customer's responsibility to inform Bikosports without delay. Bikosports will recover such funds by account adjustment.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, all examples given on the Website are given in TZS.</p>

<h2>WITHDRAWALS</h2>
<p>Where possible, all withdrawals will be processed to the payment account from which the deposits were made. Withdrawal payments can only be made in the name of and to the registered account holder.</p>
<p>If the value of a deposit is not played through in full before a withdrawal is requested, Bikosports reserves the right to make a charge to the customer’s account to cover all reasonable costs relating to both the deposit and withdrawal. If necessary, the value of the withdrawal requested may be reduced accordingly.</p>
<h2>OTHER</h2>
<p>If we incur any charge-backs, reversals or other charges in respect of your account, we reserve the right to charge you for the relevant amounts incurred.</p>

<p>You are responsible for reporting your winnings and losses to the tax and/or other authorities in your jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>4. BET PROCEDURES</h2>
<p>Each Client must verify that bet details and the amount staked are correct before confirming a bet. Once confirmed, a bet cannot be changed or cancelled by the Client.</p>

<h2>5. BET PAYMENT ERRORS</h2>
<p>Circumstances may arise where a bet is confirmed, or a payment is processed, in error.</p>
<p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of such circumstances:</p>
<p>- When the prices offered by the Company are significantly dissimilar from those available in the general market;</p>
<p>- Where a bet containing dependent events is accidentally accepted, because of human or technical error;</p>
<p>- When a settling (resulting) error is made while computing or crediting the amount of winnings to a Client account;</p>
<p>- When a deposit or withdrawal is incorrectly recorded.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In all such cases, the Company reserves the right to correct all financial transactions, cancel accepted bets relating to the error or re-settle bets at the correct price that should have been available at the time the bet was placed.</p>
<h2>6. BET AMOUNT, MAXIMUM MINIMUM</h2>
<p> - The minimum stake (bet amount) is TZS 1 (one shilling)</p>

<h2> 7. BIKOSPORTS WIN BONUS</h2>
<p>Your bonus percentage is determined by the number of matches completed. Therefore, any games in your multi-bet which are cancelled or postponed won’t count towards your total.</p>
<p></p>
<p> - 1 legs 0% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 2 legs 0% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 3 legs 3% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 4 legs 5% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 5 legs 10% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 6 legs 15% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 7 legs 20% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 8 legs 25% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 9 legs 30% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 10 legs 35% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 11 legs 40% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 12 legs 45% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 13 legs 50% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 14 legs 55% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 15 legs 60% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 16 legs 65% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 17 legs 70% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 18 legs 75% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 19 legs 80% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 20 legs 85% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 21 legs 90% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 22 legs 95% Win Bonus</p>
<p> - 23 legs 100% Win Bonus</p>
<p>Your win bonus is calculated based on your winnings excluding the stake. So, if you staked TZS 1000 and won TZS 10,000, your winnings without the stake would be TZS 9,000. Therefore, a 50% win bonus would be TZS 4,500 and your total payout combining initial winnings and win bonus would be TZS 14,500.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Win bonus will be given based on business guidelines, in that case factor like, Odds, Options, Market competitions etc. will be considered for one to qualify for Win bonus.</p>
