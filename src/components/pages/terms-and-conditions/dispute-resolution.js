                    In the event of a dispute arising between us and you, we each agree to
                    follow the procedure set out in our Dispute Resolution policy as amended

                    If Bikosports is unable to settle the dispute, Bikosports will refer the
                    dispute to an arbiter, whose decision will be final (save in respect of
                    any manifest error) subject to full representation given to all parties
                    involved. No dispute regarding any bet/wager will result in litigation,
                    court action or objection to a bookmaker’s licence or permit (including
                    any remote operator’s licence or personal licence) unless Bikosports fails
                    to implement the decision given by arbitration.
