                        In the instance a CLIENT attempts to withdraw funds that were
                        deposited but not used for staking, Bikosports may levy a processing
                        fee of
                        20% upon such withdrawals. Bikosports reserves the right to investigate
                        any
                        and all suspicious activities related to such withdrawals and report
                        the
                        same to the relevant authorities. Additionally, the CLIENT will lose
                        all
                        the deposited funds.

                        Payouts handled manually through an ordinary bank transfer are
                        processed within Seventy-Two (72) banking hours and are subject to
                        additional carrier fees. However, the CLIENT acknowledges that we
                        are at
                        the mercy of the banks and Payment service providers in this regard
                        and
                        cannot do anything to speed up this process.

                        The CLIENT agrees not to attempt any chargebacks, reversals or
                        otherwise cancel any deposit previously made in his/her Account.
                        Whenever any such event should occur the CLIENT commits to refund
                        Bikosports for the unpaid deposits and for possible expenses resulting
                        from

                        as trustee for the CLIENT and not as his/her banker or debtor.
                        Accordingly, there will be no obligation on the part of Bikosports
                        Kenya to
                        repay money to the Customer as his/her debtor. Additionally, no
