    <h1>Purpose</h1>

    <p>The scope of this process applies to all who use Bethipo ’s money remittance services as well as Bethipo ’s employees.</p>

    <h1>Objectives</h1>
    <p>The objectives of this AML policy include:</p>

    <h1>Policies</h1>
    <p><strong>Definition of Money Laundering</strong></p>
    <p>a) Money laundering is generally defined as engaging in acts designed to conceal or disguise the true origins of criminally derived proceeds so that the proceeds appear to have derived from legitimate origins or constitute legitimate assets.</p>
    <p>b) Terrorist financing may not involve the proceeds of criminal conduct, but rather an attempt to conceal either the origin of the funds or their intended use, which could be for criminal purposes.</p>
    <h1>Bethipo’s AML Approach</h1>
    <p>a) In order to ensure that Bethipo does not promote ML/TF activities, the company is keen to foster and promote the following culture of compliance including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Establishing a system of internal controls and policies and procedures to assure ongoing compliance with AML requirements; </li>
    <li>Ensuring independent testing of AML compliance, of a scope and frequency that matches the money laundering and terrorist financing risks present;</li>
    <li>Training staff, as warranted for individual jobs, in the identification of unusual financial transactions or suspicious activities, in the recording and aggregation of currency
    transactions, and all legal requirements and Bethipo’s compliance policies and procedures; and </li>
    <li>Designating an individual or individuals responsible for assuring day-to-day AML compliance within Bethipo.</li>
    <li>Carrying out regular monitoring and review exercises to ensure AML compliance</li>

    <p>d) ML/TF risk treatment measures will be regularly audited to ensure that new or changed risks are covered appropriately.</p>
    <p>e) ML/TF risk identification and assessment will be guided by the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What are the entry and exit points at Bethipo for funds that may come from illicit sources?</li>
    <li>What Bethipo departments or employees are best positioned to detect the entry and exit of such funds?</li>
    <li>What are characteristics of transactions that may involve illicit funds, or of customers who are more likely to engage in suspicious activity?</li>
    <li>What mitigation measures or elimination measures can Bethipo employ? </li>
    </ul>
