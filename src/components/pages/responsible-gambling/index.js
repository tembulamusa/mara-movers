                            responsibility very seriously. Our products are designed for your entertainment and enjoyment

                            <h2>2 RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING TIPS</h2>

                            <p>We believe that gambling should always be an enjoyable leisure activity. Remembering these
                            simple tips can help make sure your gambling does not become a problem.</p>

                            <p>1. Gambling should be entertaining and not seen as a way of making money.</p>

                            <p>2. Bet sensibly and never chase losses.</p>

                            <p>3. Only gamble what you can afford to lose.</p>

                            <p>4. Monitor the amount of time you spend playing.</p>

                            <p>5. Balance gambling with other activities. If gambling is your only form of entertainment,
                            think about whether you are still having fun.</p>

                            <p>6. Take regular breaks from gambling. Gambling continuously will cause you to lose track
                            of time and perspective.</p>

                            <p>7. Do not gamble when under the influence of alcohol or any substance/circumstance that
                            may impair your judgment or when you are upset or depressed.</p>

                            <p>8. Think about how much money you spend gambling. You can track your activity in your
                            bet history.</p>

                            <h2>SELF-EXCLUSION</h2>

                            <p>For a few customers gambling might become a serious problem. We offer a self-exclusion
                            option that can be easily implemented by a customer's request.</p>

                            <p>To self-exclude from accessing our products,</p>

                            <p>1. Please contact Customer Services and give clear written instructions of the self-exclsion
                            measure you would like implemented on your specific account;<br/>
                            the customer ought to be diligent to ensure that the withdrawal has been made from
                            their Bikosports wallet and all the information and documentation above has been sent in
                            full;</p>

                            <p>Once the self-exclusion application is made by you, you are advised not to place any
                            bets as that would rescind the existing application. Any running bets placed prior to self-
                            exclusion applied will continue to be in place and any winnings will be credited into your
                            account as soon as the event is settled.</p>

                            <p>Once you make an application to self-exclude, or communicate with our customer
                            service team on email, refrain from accessing your account under any circumstance. In
                            circumstances where this is not possible, we will contact you for the sole purpose of
                            obtaining alternative refund method details. Refunds to such alternative method shall be
                            processed subject to it being successfully verified.</p>

                            <p>Access to account and our games and services will be restricted throughout the self-exclusion
                            period, or permanently if permanent self-exclusion was applied.<br/>
                            If permanent exclusion is applied, your account will be permanently blocked and no re-activation is possible.</p>

                            <p>2. Bikosports reserves the right to exclude a customer for a longer period at our discretion. This may
                            include instances where Bikosports is informed by legitimate sources (e.g. regulators or other
                            authorities, authorized professional organizations, authorized medical professional etc.) that may warrant extension of a customer's self-exclusion period.</p>

                            <p>3.  We may receive problem gambler or problem gambling related information concerning our
                            customers from third parties from time to time. Such information will be acted upon ONLY IF
                            they are received directly from the following legitimate third parties:</p>

                            <p>a) Regulators or other similar authorities;</p>

                            <p>b) Authorized professional organizations that help and provide support to problem
                            gamblers; or</p>

                            <p>c) The customer's authorized medical general practitioner.</p>

                            <p>Information received from any other third parties will be afforded due consideration, but will not
                            be acted upon in isolation. Activities of a customer who has been reported as problem gambler
                            by such third parties will be monitored to establish if the person displays any signs of gambling
                            problem. Whilst we recognize that information may be provided by such third parties with good
                            intentions and for appropriate reasons, it may not always be the case. Rather than acting solely
                            based on unverified information received, we will undertake appropriate monitoring and
                            assessment of suspected problem gamblers to identify if the reported customer is potentially a
                            problem gambler. We will not, at any point, discuss and/or disclose any aspect of customer's
                            account with such third parties (related or otherwise).</p>

                            <h2>4 PREVENTING UNDERAGE GAMBLING</h2>

                            <p>It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to gamble. Bikosports takes its responsibilities to
                            prevent access by persons under the permitted age very seriously. We make it clear in our Terms
                            and Conditions and in the account registration process that underage gambling is illegal. We
                            reserve the right to carry out verification checks to ensure that all account holders are at least 18
                            years old and may suspend an account until adequate verification is received.</p>

                            <p>It is unlawful to allow minors to gamble and we ask our customers to do their part in ensuring
                            that this does not happen. We ask all of our customers, and in fact it is the responsibility of our
                            customers, to ensure that their account is not used for under aged gambling. Some suggestions
                            on how to make sure this does not happen are provided below:</p>

                            <p>a) Do not leave your computer unattended when you are logged on to our website.</p>
                            <p>b) Make sure to logout when you leave our website.</p>
                            <p>c) Do not share your Mobile Money account details. </p>
                            <p>d) Do not leave the "Save Password" option enabled.</p>

                            <p>e) Use child protection software.</p>
                            <p>f) Create separate computer profiles for your children.</p>

                            <h2>5 COMPLAINTS</h2>

                            <p>Bikosports endeavours to make a customer's experience with us an enjoyable one. However, there
                            may be occasions where a customer feels dissatisfied with the quality of our product/s or our
                            customer service. A customer may raise a complaint by sending an e-mail to our Customer
                            Service.</p>

                            <p>We will endeavor to handle complaints as soon as practicable. We request our clients to be
                            patient with our internal processes owing to the number of requests we receive on a daily basis,
                            system upgrades, changes requested by the regulator and new instructions from the customer.</p>

                            <p>A complaint shall be deemed to have been submitted in a valid manner when it contains clear
                            information regarding the customer's identity and gives all relevant details giving rise to the
                            complaint.</p>
